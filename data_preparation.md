# Data Preparation & Sharing

---

For those working on projects with individuals (e.g.,  10 deer or 50 crabs), you should prepare at least one (meta)data file. The file should follow tidy data principles (Wickham 2014). Briefly, each row should represent one individual and each column should have information about that individual. Additionally, each column should only contain one type of data. Each sheet in an excel workbook should only contain 1 table of tidy data. If you have multiple tables of data, they should separated into different sheets in an excel workbook. For some students, one row of data may be something other than an individual.  For example, your metadata files could have one video/site/transect per row. You could have additional data on the organisms observed at your sites. Follow the format specified by your mentor.

For those with DNA data, your DNA will be turned into data by a sequencing facility and delivered to you.

To share your data, and track your analysis, we are going to utilize github. Please send me your github user id ASAP. If you donâ€™t have a github account, please create one (mentors too). Git is a version control software and github is a cloudstorage server that serves as the hub of collaborative projects like yours and it is where the master copy of your data and data analysis scripts lie. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/ .
