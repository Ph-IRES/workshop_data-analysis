# global test of model, differences in species composition with depth and site
  #The global test of the whole model is the most powerful test of your hypothesis that you can perform. The result of this test should be the first reported in your results for the test of your model.  If the global test of the model is not significant, then there is no reason to test the individual terms of the model.  In the example here, the global test is significant (see the `Pr(>F)` column in the PERMANOVA table.)
