# GitHub Account

To share your data, and track your analysis, we are going to utilize github.  Please send me your github user id ASAP.  If you donâ€™t have a github account, please create one (mentors too).  Git is a version control software and github is a cloudstorage server that serves as the hub of collaborative projects like yours and it is where the master copy of your data and data analysis scripts lie. https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/ .
