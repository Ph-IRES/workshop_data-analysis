# Data Science Philosophy

Github makes following core data science philosophy easy.  The philosophy is, after data is digitized, all manipulations of the data should be documented and executed in code. This facilitates transparency, reproduction of methods, and we are progressing toward a day when you’re scientific research papers will be rejected if you don’t provide the scripts used to process your data.
