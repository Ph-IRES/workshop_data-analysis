# Exercise: Curate Your Personal Repo

Everybody has been asked to create their own person repo before coming to the workshop.  If you have not, consult the [Tutorial on Making a GitHub Repo from the Template](tutorial_github_makerepo)   It should be in the [PhIRES GitHub Organization](https://github.com/orgs/Ph-IRES/repositories).
