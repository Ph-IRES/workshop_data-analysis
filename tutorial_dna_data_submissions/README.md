# Submitting DNA Data to NCBI GenBank and GEOME DataBase

We will use the [GEOME](https://geome-db.org/) suite of tools to submit our DNA sequences and the associated metadata to both the GEOME Database as well as [NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). 

[NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) houses DNA sequence data, but very little associated metadata for those sequences that we typically generate in projects focused on moleculary ecology, evolution, and conservation genetics.  That's where the [GEOME DataBase](https://geome-db.org/) comes in, storing metadata that GenBank won't accept and linking that metadata to the DNA sequences in GenBank.

## Getting Acclimated to GEOME

![](https://geome-db.org/docs/geomeWorkflow.png)

1. Goto GEOME's [Getting Started Web Page](https://geome-db.org/about) and make an account. After creating your account, login.

2. Return to GEOME's [Getting Started Web Page](https://geome-db.org/about) and 

	* read the "Creating Projects & Expeditions" section.  
		* We will generally enter our data as part of the Diversity of the IndoPacific (DIPNet) Team
	* read the "Minimum Information Requirements" section
	* read the "Data usage policy" section

3. Read the [User Guide to Creating Local Identifiers](https://fims.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fims/identifiers.html), aka sample names.  Then discuss the local identifiers you want to use in your project with your mentor/advisor

	_Note that you can consult the [GeOMe Help Document](https://geome-db.org/docs/helpDocumentation.pdf)_

## Creating a New Project in GEOME

1. Goto GEOME's [Create a Project as Part of an Existing Team](https://geome-db.org/project/new) page. Consult with your mentor or advisor on the following information, then enter it and create a project.

	* Project Title
	* Project Description
	* Select "Join a Team Workspace"
	* Existing team workspace (DIPNet)
	* Don't check "Public Project" right now, you can change it later.
