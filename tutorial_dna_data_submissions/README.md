# Submitting DNA Data to NCBI GenBank and GEOME DataBase

We will use the [GEOME](https://geome-db.org/) suite of tools to submit our DNA sequences and the associated metadata to both the GEOME Database as well as [NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

[NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) houses DNA sequence data, but very little associated metadata for those sequences that we typically generate in projects focused on moleculary ecology, evolution, and conservation genetics.  That's where the [GEOME DataBase](https://geome-db.org/) comes in, storing metadata that GenBank won't accept and linking that metadata to the DNA sequences in GenBank.  

You can read more about GEOME here:

## Using GEOME

![](https://geome-db.org/docs/geomeWorkflow.png)

1. Goto GEOME's [Getting Started Web Page](https://geome-db.org/about) and make an account. After creating your account, login.

2. Return to GEOME's [Getting Started Web Page](https://geome-db.org/about) and read the "Creating Projects & Expeditions" section.  We will generally enter our data as part of the Diversity of the IndoPacific (DIPNet) Team.

3. On to GEOME's [Getting Started Web Page](https://geome-db.org/about), read the "Minimum Information Requirements" section.
