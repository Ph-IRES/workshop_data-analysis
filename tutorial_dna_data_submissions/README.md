# Submitting DNA Data to NCBI GenBank and MetaData to GEOME DataBase

We will use the [GEOME](https://geome-db.org/) suite of tools to submit our DNA sequences and the associated metadata to both the GEOME Database as well as [NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). 

[NCBI GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) houses DNA sequence data, but very little associated metadata for those sequences that we typically generate in projects focused on moleculary ecology, evolution, and conservation genetics.  That's where the [GEOME DataBase](https://geome-db.org/) comes in, storing metadata that GenBank won't accept and linking that metadata to the DNA sequences in GenBank.
