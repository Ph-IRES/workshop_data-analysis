2. [Watch John Deck describe how GEOME works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuAN9LbDO-U).  "This diagram shows how data is managed in the GEOME environment. Boxes in solid blue indicate GEOME functions that the user interacts with, such as generating templates and loading data. The white boxes with a green border are functions that happen outside of the GEOME environment, such as data entry into a spreadsheet."
