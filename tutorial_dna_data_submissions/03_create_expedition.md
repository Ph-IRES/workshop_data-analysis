# Adding and Modifying Expeditions in an Existing Project

Consult with your mentor/advisor prior to creating a new expedition.  There may be an expedition that has already been created that you should use. 

1. Goto the [GEOME Workbench/View Projects Page](https://geome-db.org/workbench/dashboard) and select the project you want to add an expedition to.
