## Software Requirements (Install Prior to Workshop)

To operate git on your computers there are several options, but Dave and I have our preferences.  If you have a mac, you’re good to go.  If you have a PC, you need to be sure to install Ubunutu on the windows linux subsystem.  I suggest you take full advantage of your access to Roy Roberts, and ask him to help you with this if he hasn’t already. https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview

We will employ R, and specifically the tidyverse package, to wrangle your data into submission. I know some of you may have had negative experiences with R, as I did when I was a student. But now, I’m a convert. I like to think I’m good at teaching it and it’s really going to make your life as a scientist easier if you learn it.  Please install R on your computers if you don’t have it, or if you haven’t installed it in the last month (MAC,   PC). R is open source and is updated frequently.  We can avoid problems if our R versions are all up to date.  
To make R more convenient to use, we will employ R Studio.  Please install R Studio on your computers if you don’t have it or if you haven’t installed it in the past month.   Go here https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ and select R Studio Desktop FREE.
