I tried to make it easier to get the correct statistical model by breaking it down to the different components
	* response var
		* binomial response vars
	* [fixed effect vars](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~ghobbs/STAT_512/Lecture_Notes/ANOVA/Topic_34.pdf)
	* [random effect vars](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~ghobbs/STAT_512/Lecture_Notes/ANOVA/Topic_34.pdf)

Consult the R script
