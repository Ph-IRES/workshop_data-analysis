# Software Requirements (Install Prior to Workshop)

---

To operate git on your computers there are several options, but Dave and I have our preferences.  If you have a mac, you’re good to go.  If you have a PC, you need to [be sure to install Ubunutu on the windows linux subsystem](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview).  I suggest you take full advantage of your access to Roy Roberts, and ask him to help you with this if he hasn’t already. 

We will employ R, and specifically the tidyverse package, to wrangle your data into submission. I know some of you may have had negative experiences with R, as I did when I was a student. But now, I’m a convert. I like to think I’m good at teaching it and it’s really going to make your life as a scientist easier if you learn it.  [Please install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) on your computers if you don’t have it, or if you haven’t installed it in the last month (MAC, PC). R is open source and is updated frequently.  We can avoid problems if our R versions are all up to date.  

To make R more convenient to use, we will employ R Studio.  Please install R Studio on your computers if you don’t have it or if you haven’t installed it in the past month.   Go [here and select R Studio Desktop FREE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Install a text editor. Our recommended free editors:
   * For Macs: the free version of [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)
   * For Windows (PCs): [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

[Install Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/download/). Be sure to download appropriately for your operating system.  Also, follow the “request a trial” link to get a 14 day trial license.  Please check your spam/junk folders, as this is where your trial license will usually end up.  *Don’t activate your license until next week.*  

[Install FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).  There are packages available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
