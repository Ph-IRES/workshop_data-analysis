## Ubunutu (Windows Only)

If you have a PC, you need to be sure to install Ubunutu on the windows linux subsystem and the windows terminal. MacOS is based on Unix, so there is no need to install this on a Mac.

* [Install Ubuntu on WindowsOS](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/how_to/blob/main/install_wsl_ubuntu.md)

* [Install Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install)

    * Windows Terminal will open PowerShell automatically. Click the "v" symbol next to the "+" (new tab) button and go to "Settings".
    * The first option under "Startup" is "Default Profile". Change this to "Ubuntu" and save your changes.
    * To open again, just type "Terminal" in the taskbar search bar and open the App.

## R and R Studio

We will employ R, and specifically the tidyverse package, to wrangle your data into submission. I know some of you may have had negative experiences with R, as I did when I was a student. But now, I’m a convert. I like to think I’m good at teaching it and it’s really going to make your life as a scientist easier if you learn it.  
Please install R on your computers if you haven’t installed it in the last month (MAC or PC). R is open source and is updated frequently.  We can avoid problems if our R versions are all up to date.  

For this workshop, only follow instructions for installing "R on Win" or "R on Mac":

* [Installing R Tutorial]([https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://github.com/tamucc-comp-bio/how_to/blob/main/install_r.md)

To make R more convenient to use, we will employ R Studio.  Please install R Studio on your computers if you don’t have it or if you haven’t installed it in the past month.   Go [here and select R Studio Desktop FREE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

Install a text editor which is critial for viewing/editing DNA files or geomorphometric files.  The editors installed by your OS are inferior to our recommended free editors:
   * For Macs: the free version of [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/)
   * For Windows (PCs): [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

[Install Geneious](https://www.geneious.com/download/). Be sure to download appropriately for your operating system.  Also, follow the “request a trial” link to get a 14 day trial license.  Please check your spam/junk folders, as this is where your trial license will usually end up.  *Don’t activate your license until next week.*

[Install FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).  There are packages available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
