#1.4.3 exercises

# 1) Make a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?
#   
# 2)  How are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?
#   
#     ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
#       geom_bar(color = "red")
# 
#     ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) +
#       geom_bar(fill = "red")
# 
# 3) What does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?
#   
# 4) Make a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package. 
#     Experiment with different binwidths. What binwidth reveals the most interesting patterns?
#

#adding mappings for species and island

##Section 3: Data Manipulation

flights

#The first tidyverse row function: filter

#filter operates on ROWS and filters IN (includes matching rows)

flights |> 
  filter(dep_delay > 120)

# Flights that departed on January 1
flights |> 
  filter(month == 1 & day == 1)

# Flights that departed in January or February
flights |> 
  filter(month == 1 | month == 2)

# multiple operations in a pipe

flights |> 
  filter(dep_delay > 120) |>
  filter(month == 1 & day == 1)

# A shorter way to select flights that departed in January or February
# note the %in% operator.  this includes anything in the following list.  Note that the Boolean OR is invoked here.  

flights |> 
  filter(month %in% c(1, 2))

#saving to a variable
jan1 <- flights |> 
  filter(month == 1 & day == 1)
#calling the variable
jan1

##Section 3.2.2: Common Mistakes

flights |> 
  filter(month = 1)

flights |> 
  filter(month == 1 | 2)

#3.2.3 our next row function: arrange
#changes order of rows based on column values

flights |> 
  arrange(dep_delay,year, month, day)

#change sort order to descending (ascending is default)
flights |> 
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))

#3.2.4 distinct

# Remove duplicate rows, if any
flights |> 
  distinct()

# Find all unique origin and destination pairs
flights |> 
  distinct(origin, dest)

#as above, keeping all columns
flights |> 
  distinct(origin, dest, .keep_all = TRUE)

#Section 3.3: Column functions

#mutate (you'll probably use this one more than any other)

new_flights <- flights |>

  mutate(

    hours = air_time / 60,

#select: filters by column instead of row
#just like filter, select selects IN, not OUT

flights |> 
  select(year, month, day)

flights |> 
  select(year:day)

flights |> 
  select(!year:day)

flights |> 
  select(where(is.numeric))

#one way to rename a column
#syntax for this is select(<new_value> = <old_value>)

new_flights <- flights |> 
  select(tail_num = tailnum)

#rename can also be used for this
new_flights <- flights |> 
  rename(tail_num = tailnum)

#relocate

  relocate(time_hour, air_time)

flights |> 
  relocate(year:dep_time, .after = time_hour)

##Section 3.5: group_by() and summarize()

flights |> 
  group_by(month)

#try this with slice_head, slice_tail, slice_min, slice_sample

flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  slice_min(arr_delay, n = 1) |>
  relocate(dest)

#grouping by multiple variables

daily <- flights |>  
  group_by(year, month, day)
daily

daily_flights <- daily |>

## Section 5: Data tidying and pivoting

#table 1 is tidy
